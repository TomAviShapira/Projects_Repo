# AUTOMATIC BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL USING INTERPRETABLE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING MODEL

</div>

## Abstract

Blood pressure control is a common task in the medical world. This task is especially necessary
during and after cardiac sur-gical interventions because some of the natural control sys-tems
of the body are disrupted. Intervention like that can cause the blood pressure to rise or fall dramatically, 
so in order to prevent a life-threatening situation, it needs to be monitored and controlled. As of today, 
this problem is solved by drugs treatment, given by a medical staff member that must monitor the
patient’s blood pressure often and give him an exact dose of a drug which is difficult to calculate.
In this paper we first discuss a solution for automatic blood pressure control using reinforcement learning.
This solution is considered as a ”black box” that is hard to interpretate or verify. Thus, we suggest a PID
controller solution that is tuned based on the reinforce-ment learning solution. Besides our goal of 
implementing automatic blood pressure control system, this paper demon-strates how a real problem in
the medical world can be solved through reinforcement learning while receiving a generalized interpretable
model that can be verified.
