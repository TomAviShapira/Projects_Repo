# Algorithm For Managing Landings And Takeoffs In An Optimal Way

</div>

## Abstract

Planning is an important human ability, starting at a young age. To perform this task, the brain
must synchronize and combine several cognitive systems, such as controlling and processing the resulting data.
In this project, we will implement an algorithm that performs efficient planning in order to find an order of the
takeoffs and landings of aircraft. This is when the main aspect is finding the optimal order which will result for
each aircraft finding minimum takeoff / landing times.
We developed the algorithm in Python environment while combining a GUI interface for user convenience.
At its core, the algorithm needs to know how to obtain input data about the take-off and landing times of the
aircraft and extract their optimal order of operations, including the operating times of each aircraft.
In addition, it must provide redesign capability in case of various emergency malfunctions.
